# C-Babbitt-Square-Calculator
The Babbitt Square Matrix Calculator

Hello, world! This is my first more-or-less working code on C++. This program is a Matrix Calculator for one of the twelve-tone techniques - Babbitt Square. More about it you may find here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEwMPl7lsrg

To get the full Matrix, type the numbers of the pc-sets using spaces in one line, press Enter. Then if you're looking for something specific (for example for Retrograde 3 or Inversion 10), type it in next line with the step together.

List of commands:

PRIME - P
INVERSION - I
RETROGRADE - R
RETROGRADE-INVERSION - RI

Example:
5 7 1 2 0 9 10 8 4 6 3 11 ---> Enter

< ---------------- SQUARE WILL BE HERE ------------------>

RI10
<--- ROW OF RI10----->
I3
<----ROW OF I3------->
and so on....
